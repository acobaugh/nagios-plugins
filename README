These are miscellaneous Nagios plugins/check scripts that I've developed
for various systems while employed by Penn State.

A lot of them will make assumptions about where things are installed, and some
may have no bearing on anything outside of PSU, but may still serve as an
inspiration to others.

I welcome any changes and contributions to these scripts. If you find them
useful, please let me know!
